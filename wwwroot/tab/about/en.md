NanoSite is a minimal website system for creators.
No build steps and no runtime to install — just write Markdown and it becomes a beautiful web page, then use GitHub to share it with the world.

Our goal is to make “writing = site building,” so you can work as effortlessly as taking notes and turn Markdown documents directly into a complete website.

Let’s get started: ➡️ [Meet NanoSite](?id=post/main/v2.0.0/main_en.md).

> If you’re not allergic to docs, here’s an even better starter: ➡️ [NanoSite Documentation](?id=post/doc/v2.1.0/doc_en.md). 😊
