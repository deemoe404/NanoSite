# How to Enable GitHub Pages for a Repository

To enable GitHub Pages for your repository, follow these steps:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on **Settings**.
3. Scroll down to the **Pages** section in the sidebar.
4. Under **Source**, select the branch you want to use (usually `main` or `master`).
5. (Optional) Select a folder, such as `/root` or `/docs`.
6. Click **Save**.
7. After a few moments, your site will be published. The URL will be shown in the Pages section.

## Notes
- Make sure your repository is public if you want everyone to access your site.
- You can use a custom domain by configuring it in the same section.
